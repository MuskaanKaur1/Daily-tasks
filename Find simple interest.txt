Q). Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Take input from the user
principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount in Rs: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time period in years: "))
rate_of_interest = float(input("Enter the rate of interest per year in %: "))

# Simple Interest formula: SI = (P * T * R) / 100
simple_interest = (principal * time * rate_of_interest) / 100

# Print the result
print(f"The Simple Interest is Rs. {simple_interest}.")
